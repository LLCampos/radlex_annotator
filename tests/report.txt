Epidemiology: The incidence is Female:Male 2:1. Mean patient age at presentation is 30 - 50 years. Etiology: •Benign synovial proliferation within tendon sheath, most commonly involving fingers


Signs/Symptoms: ◦Usually painless slow-growing mass, presents weeks to years ◦Prior trauma reported in 1-5% Location ◦Hand > wrist > ankle/foot > knee > elbow > hip ◦85% in fingers

◦Localized type is most common ◦Nodular synovitis reflects solitary intraarticular nodule ◦Diffuse type is extraarticular, soft tissue mass
GCTTS: Masses are usually solitary and well-defined, and joint effusion is usually absent (solid excised masses recur infrequently). Pigmented villonodular tenosynovitis represents the diffuse intra-articular form of the same etiology (high rate of local recurrence in the extrasynovial localization.)
Imaging: MRI is the preferred noninvasive imaging, as the lesions are not well characterized on XR and CT. MRI diagnosis must be confirmed by pathological examination because of the differential concern of soft tissue sarcoma. Venous malformation is another consideration, however, they generally are more infiltrative rather than a ball-like mass. Also, VM typically will not have solid enhancement, rather patchy enhancement.
FOR GCTTS: •True bone invasion rather than focal erosion is not typical and is suggestive of aggressive neoplasm •Reactive soft tissue edema is atypical

Our patient underwent core needle biopsy performed by interventional radiology. Once initial pathology confirmed giant cell tumor of tendon sheath, she was scheduled for non-emergent local excision. Final path also correlated with this diagnosis. Treatment: Local excision.
